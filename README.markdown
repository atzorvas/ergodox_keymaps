# Keyboard layouts for ErgoDox

## Building your own layout

If you're looking to configure your ErgoDox, you definitely should check out the [keyboard-configurator from massdrop](https://keyboard-configurator.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox), which has a beautiful configuration tool (the screen displays are taken from that).

Notes on that configuration tool: 

- the `~L1` key is layer-whilst-pressed

1. Take a screenshot of your configuration (from the configuration tool or wherever)

## Keymaps

#### Seth configuration

I'm on a mac, I use [emacs shortcuts for movement](https://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/system-bindings.html), so `Ctrl` is very important.

I use my computer for programming and writing.

#### Default ErgoDox EZ configuration:
