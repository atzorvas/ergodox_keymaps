# Keyboard layouts for ErgoDox

## Building your own layout

If you're looking to configure your ErgoDox, you definitely should check out the [keyboard-configurator from massdrop](https://keyboard-configurator.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox), which has a beautiful configuration tool.

Notes on that configuration tool: 

- the `~L1` key is layer-whilst-pressed



## Keymaps

#### Querty configuration from keyboard-configurator

#### Seth configuration

I'm on a mac, I use [emacs shortcuts for movement](https://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~jrus/site/system-bindings.html), so `Ctrl` is very important.

I use my computer for programming and writing.

#### Default ErgoDox EZ configuration:

I'm not sure how to download this keymap to reinstall it.

A pull request with the right information would be spectacular.
